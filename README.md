Destroyable
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pintxo/Destroyable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pintxo/Destroyable)

The destroyable component is designed to make sure every component within the Pintxos framework implements the same lifecycle API.

This component should'nt be used on its own, instead it can serve as a base layer for other components.
